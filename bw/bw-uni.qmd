Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
```{r}
 #|fig_cap: "Whether Chesses are Vegtarian or Not"
 #|fig_alt: "This Plot shows the Amount of Chesses that are Considered Vegetarian by Chesse.com."
ggplot(cheeses, aes(x = vegetarian)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x = "Vegetarian", y = "chesse count", title = "Amount of Cheeses that are Vegetarian or Not.")
```
