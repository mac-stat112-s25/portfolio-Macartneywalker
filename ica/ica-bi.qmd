Use this file for practice with the **bivariate viz** in-class activity.  Refer to the class website for details.
```{r}
# Import data

# How many students have now filled out the survey? 49
dim(survey)

# What type of variables do we have?qualitative?

```
```{r}
# Attach a package needed to use the ggplot function


# Make a ggplot
library(ggplot2)
